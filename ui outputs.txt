## ✅ 🎯 What Smart AQI Guardian Will Deliver

---

### 🟢 **1. Live Air Quality for a Specific Location**
**User Input:** Location name or GPS coordinates  
**Backend:** Pulls from OpenWeatherMap + AQI APIs  
**Output (UI + JSON):**
```json
{
  "location": "Chennai",
  "aqi": 97,
  "status": "Moderate",
  "pm2_5": 71,
  "pm10": 96,
  "temperature": 32,
  "humidity": 65,
  "wind_speed": 3.7
}
```
**Frontend UI**: Real-time AQI card with colored alert badge.

### 🟠 **2. AQI Spike Prediction (Short-Term Forecast)**
**User Input:** Location  
**Backend:** Your trained ML model  
**Output:**
```json
{
  "predicted_aqi": 142,
  "risk_level": "High",
  "prediction_for": "next 1 hour",
  "confidence": 0.87
}
```
**UI Component**: “Incoming Spike” alert card.

### 🔵 **3. Cause Analysis of AQ Spike**
**Backend Logic:** Rule-based or ML classifier  
**Example Output:**
```json
{
  "cause": "Heavy traffic and low wind",
  "confidence": "Moderate",
  "suggested_action": "Reroute traffic, limit outdoor activity"
}
```
**UI**: Display as part of alert banner or insights card.

### 🟣 **4. Smart Recommendations**
**Types:**
- Health warning: “Limit outdoor activity”
- Safe route suggestions (static or placeholder)
- “Avoid industrial zone at 4–6 PM”
- Factory compliance flag (if simulated)

---

### 🔶 **5. Dashboard Analytics (Graphs for Judges & Demo)**
- 📊 Time-series AQI graph (today vs yesterday)
- 📊 PM2.5 and PM10 levels as line/bar charts
- 📈 Prediction accuracy chart (optional)

---

### 🟤 **6. API Endpoints for Integration**
| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/weather` | GET | Live weather and air data |
| `/predict` | POST | Predict AQI based on current readings |
| `/insights` | GET | Cause + Recommendation |
| `/simulate_spike` | GET | Simulate high-pollution alert (for demo) |

---

### 🧠 Optional (For Hackathon Bonus):
- 🛰️ Satellite pollution overlay (if available)
- 🔄 Auto-refresh dashboard every 5 minutes
- 📍 AQI map of 2–3 cities (static or simulated)

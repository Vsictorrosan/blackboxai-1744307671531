# Integration Plan for Smart AQI Guardian

## 1. Frontend Interaction
- **Data Submission**: Use AJAX or Fetch API to send user input data (e.g., air quality parameters) from the `prediction.html` page to the backend `predict.py` for processing.
- **Display Predictions**: Show the predicted AQI, risk level, confidence, and contributing factors on the `prediction.html` page.

## 2. Alerts System
- **Trigger Alerts**: Implement a mechanism to trigger alerts based on the predicted AQI values. For example, if the predicted AQI exceeds a certain threshold, an alert should be displayed in `alerts.html`.
- **Alert Structure**: Use the existing alert structure in `alerts.html` to show high-priority alerts for significant AQI spikes.

## 3. Styling
- **Consistent Design**: Ensure that the new elements for displaying predictions and alerts are styled consistently with the existing design in `styles.css`.

## 4. Testing
- **Integration Testing**: Test the integration by simulating different AQI predictions and ensuring that alerts are triggered correctly.

## Follow-Up Steps
- Implement the above changes in the respective files.
- Test the functionality to ensure everything works as expected.
